                      "text": "With the release of the Bunny Brawler EP, Evan Wardell brings a new feel to a classic genre. Lush with addicting guitar progressions, an honest lyrical approach, and classic rock style, the record boasts the aesthetic of indie rock anthems. Though the songs are diverse from one another, there is a glue that holds them all together. Most importantly, the EP never loses sight of the emotional platform great songs are built from.\nThe first single, “20 Some Odd” is instant dream pop classic. Complete with musical swells, musical hooks, and an almost 90’s alternative sound, the song seems to breathe and build as it plays on.\n“The song is about all the sort of conflicting motivations that you have as a young person and \"20 something\" was a little too on the nose. ‘20 some odd’ might still be a little too much on the nose if I'm being honest though” explains the songwriter of his single.\nAlthough the single does speak volumes for the EP, to get a real understanding of where Wardell is coming from, it should be heard in its entirety.\n“All the songs on this album are pretty disparate in terms of the themes in the songs but I think sonically they have a lot of similarities. Although I guess the theme of doubt and the sort of search for meaning that comes from that doubt is something that permeates a lot of my songwriting generally” says Wardell of his songwriting approach for the release.\nMusic has always been a huge part and a first love for Evan Wardell, but it wasn’t until he was 13 years old and realized he could multi-track with two old tape recorders that his musical horizons opened up. Working on new material all the time, the songwriter went through a few different band names until he came to the conclusion that releasing his songs under his own name was the best route to take. The Bunny Brawler EP was written, performed, and recorded solely by Wardell himself and was done so to accompany a play produced by San Francisco based independent theater company, Fault Line Theater. The EP is the epitome of where he is at with his sound now.\nWardell has received a number of mentions for the plays soundtrack through reviews and is always working on new material for upcoming releases.\nThe Bunny Brawler EP is now available for streaming and downloads on most major digital outlets and the artist is currently working on putting a full band together to start performing live.\nTo learn and hear more of Evan Wardell, please visit: https://evanwardell.bandcamp.com/\n\nMy name is Scott Garred.  I am a songwriter, performer, and music therapist.  I call San Francisco home.  I just finished my first official full-length LP called Little Tiny Things,  a special project because it reunites a very dear group of friends. Shawn Camp and Tom Hudson (both of Silver Scooter) met up with me at the beautiful Idler Recording operated by Tyler Mallory (also ex-Silver Scooter) who recorded and mixed most of the songs. Dave McNair (Bob Dylan, David Bowie, Los Lobos, Willie Nelson, and of course Silver Scooter) mixed a few songs and mastered all the material. The album sounds amazing and I couldn't be happier.\nThe songs feature guitars, bass, and drums with a heavy splash of vintage keyboards.  Some rock and bounce along while others quietly strum.  The songs range in subject matter from the personal to what it might be like to live with Alzheimer’s Disease, as some of my music therapy clients do.  A deceptively simple keyboard drumbeat opens the album on the title track, but the songs’ lyrics disintegrate into the profound fears haunting memory loss: “What if you no longer can sing? What if your heart only knows darkness?”\nI was in a band called Silver Scooter from 1995 - 2001.  We released three critically acclaimed albums, and dozens of singles and E.P.’s.  Touring extensively and sharing stages with Death Cab For Cutie, Kristen Hersh, Unwound, and Olivia Tremor Control to name just a few, we frequented the SXSW Music Festival as well as CMJ.\nMy former solo music project, Super XX Man (pronounced “double x”) released a total of 17 volumes of music plus various E.P.'s and compilations - about 20 releases in all.  Most were released largely in obscurity with the exception of Vol. X (2005), a collection of previously released songs re-recorded through the lens of a new band after I moved to Portland, OR. This one release seemed to garner more praise than usual.  The Vol. X version of “Collecting Rocks” became a favorite at a half dozen or so weddings.  Bob Boilen, host of NPR’s All Songs Considered, said this about Super XX Man: “If we’re going to choose ten songs every week, let it be Super XX Man.” Amy McCoullough, former editor of the Willamette Week in Portland, OR said, “If love had a sound this would be it.”\nI toured nearly 10 years of Super XX Man’s existence, traveling through Canada, Japan, and the U.S.  Over the years I played some of the nation's more notable clubs including San Francisco's Bottom of the Hill, Make-Out Room, Purple Onion, Hemlock Tavern; Knitting Factory and Brownie's in New York; Howlin' Wolf in New Orleans; Schuba's and Empty Bottle in Chicago; and Spaceland in Los Angeles. I shared bills with Courtney Barnett, John Vanderslice, Songs Ohia, Julie Doiron, and Karl Blau.\nA career highlight of mine was performing at Bob Boilen’s Tiny Desk.  Another career highlight includes singing a duet with Julie Doiron at SXSW.  We shared the bill and spontaneously collaborated on the Eric’s Trip song, “Allergic to Love.”  \nOregon Public Broadcasting’s Oregon Art Beat featured both my music and my work as a music therapist at the Oregon State Hospital.  The award-winning program followed me to the hospital, filming intimate sessions with patients, and tagged along to hear Super XX Man rehearse and perform at the historic White Eagle Pub.  \nSuper XX Man also recorded two full-length albums in Australia while living in Melbourne from 2011 - 2015.  Vol. XIV Sorta Heavy Metal was released on Courtney Barnett’s acclaimed Milk! Records in 2012.  A successful crowd funding campaign, which brought together fans from all over the world, made this release possible.  The album garnered much praise.  Crispian Winsor, former morning host of “The Breakfast Spread” on PBS radio in Melbourne, called it the #1 release of the 2012 year.  The second Australian album, Vol. XVI Talk About, was released quietly in 2015 via Bandcamp after Garred moved back to the states.  It features country sweetheart Devon Sproule singing harmonies and a duet on the stand out track “Sparrow.”  A bonus included on the digital release features Courtney Barnett and Jen Cloher covering “Box Store,” originally released on Vol. XIII White Bed.\nwww.scottgarred.com\n\nMokai plays earthy, original music. Accompanying himself on fingerstyle guitar, he tells gripping stories, rhymes freely, and through his songs, melds the strange and beautiful into rootsy performances.\nVersed in folk blues from an early age, he creates an intimate world for his audience, with his bluesy voice, engaging lyrics, and innovative fingerpicking. Bay Area DJ Rosalie Howarth (KFOG FM) commented: “Great message in a vivid, deftly expressed package–incredible live!”\nMokai has made hundreds of appearances at festivals, house concerts, coffeehouses, nightclubs, and on radio stations. He has appeared at rallies and benefits, and in hospitals and shelters as part of Bread and Roses.\nMokai’s sound can best be compared to other current Americana players who have a singer/songwriter side, such as Kelly Joe Phelps and David Jacob Strain. His original guitar style echoes his life-long love affair with the playing of seminal bluesmen like Big Bill Broonzy, and Dave Van Ronk.\nHis moods can be reminiscent of classic songwriters like John Prine and Townes Van Zandt, with that something raw in the vocals and lyrics. Intended mostly for acoustic music lovers, Mokais songs fit into the bigger picture alongside those of Dylan and Springsteen.\nMokai is pronounced MO-ki, long ‘o’, long ‘i’; Accent on 1st syllable.\nhttp://mokaimusic.com\n\n\nAnd now, a little bit about PianoFight!\nGrab dinner and drinks before the show!

How do I take this passion of mine and make a living from it? In our intimately curated setting, our panelists discuss their background, achievements and challenges, advice they would give their young selves now, and their plans for the future to an audience of aspiring creators in their respective fields.\n\nThe focus of this month's discussion panel will be the music industry.
